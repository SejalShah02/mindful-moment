# mindful-moment
A backend-powered platform that helps users manage their mental health through:
• 📝 Daily journaling via secure API
• 😊 Mood detection from entries
• 🤖 Chatbot support for emotional check-ins
• 🔁 Feedback loop to track personal growth

🔧 Built using: Python (FastAPI), MongoDB, JWT Auth
🧪 Future Scope: AI/ML-driven mood analysis & personal recommendations

🚀 This project helped me learn a lot about real-world backend architecture, API design, and data handling — while also building something that could positively impact lives.
